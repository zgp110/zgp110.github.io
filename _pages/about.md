I am Genpei Zhang (张根培), a senior undergraduate student at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), majoring in Information and Communication Engineering. With a strong passion for research, I will go to Prof. [Min Xu](https://xulabs.github.io/min-xu/)’s lab at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) after graduation for a gap year. 

Previously, I have had the privilege of collaborating with distinguished researchers, including Prof. [Liang Zhao](https://cs.emory.edu/~lzhao41/) at Emory University and Prof. [Nuno Vasconcelos](http://www.svcl.ucsd.edu/people/nuno/) at University of California San Diego (UCSD).My current research interest primarily lies in Computer Vision and exploring the capability boundaries of VLLM.
