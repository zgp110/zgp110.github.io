I am Genpei Zhang (张根培), a senior undergraduate student at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), majoring in Information and Communication Engineering. With a strong passion for research, I will go to Prof. Min Xu’s lab at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) after graduation for a gap year. Previously, I have had the privilege of collaborating with distinguished researchers, including Prof. Liang Zhao at Emory University and Prof. Nuno Vasconcelos at UC San Diego (UCSD).My current research interest primarily lies in Computer Vision and exploring the capability boundaries of VLLM.

On this page, you’ll find my projects, publications, and academic journey. Feel free to reach out for discussions or potential collaborations!

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
